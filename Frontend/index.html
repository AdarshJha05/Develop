            An earthquake is a sudden and violent shaking of the ground caused
            by movements within the Earth's crust. These movements occur along
            faults, which are fractures or zones of weakness in the Earth's
            crust where tectonic plates interact. When stress along a fault
            exceeds the strength of the rocks, it results in sudden release of
            energy in the form of seismic waves, causing the ground to shake.
            Earthquakes can vary in size and intensity, ranging from small
            tremors that are barely felt to major quakes that can cause
            widespread destruction. They can also trigger other natural
            disasters such as tsunamis, landslides, and aftershocks. The
            severity of an earthquake is measured on the Richter scale or the
            moment magnitude scale. These scales quantify the amount of energy
            released by an earthquake. The effects of an earthquake depend on
            various factors including its magnitude, depth, distance from the
            epicenter, and the local geological conditions. Earthquakes are
            natural phenomena that occur worldwide and are a constant reminder
            of the dynamic processes shaping the Earth's surface. Understanding
            earthquake mechanics and implementing appropriate safety measures
            can help minimize their impact on human lives and infrastructure
